            Peter Norvig's <em><a href="https://github.com/norvig/pytudes">pytudes</a></em> is a great collection of notebooks<sup><a href="#ref">2</a></sup>, covering a vast amount of topics, from logic and number theory, to economics, to language processing
            and general computer science algorithms. Since 2016, Norvig has been publishing his solutions for the <a href="http://www.adventofcode.com">Advent of
            Code</a> in Jupyter Notebooks. Following his example, I did the same thing this year. Except, instead of using <em>Python</em>, I used <em>Kotlin</em> <sup><a href="#ref">3</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>The Advent of Code is a great opportunity to improve your programming and problem solving skills. From Dec 1<sup>st</sup> - Dec 25<sup>th</sup>, each day two tasks are released at 12:00pm Eastern Time (EST). From then on, the clock is ticking!
            Since I was in Sydney at that time, tasks were released at 4:00pm in the afternoon. Because of work, I could not always manage to start right away, which meant that the competition often had a head start.
        </p>

        <h3>Preview for Day 1</h3>

        <p>Below you can see an excerpt from my notebook that demonstrates my solution for Day 1, where the task was to solve what they called an "inverse-captcha", to prove that you are <em>not</em> a human:

            <p>
                You can find my complete solution for the AoC 2017 <a href="https://github.com/rafaelkonlechner/advent-of-code-2017/blob/master/Advent%20of%20Code%202017.ipynb">here</a>, hosted on GitHub.</p>

            <h3>Scores and Numbers</h3>

            <p>
                Overall, I am quite satisfied with my score, even though I was not well prepared enough to compete with the top programmers &mdash; both in terms of setup and experience. I learned that the best competitors prepare with a large library of convenience
                functions, interpreted languages and automated submission scripts. As for my personal score, I got into the top 500 consistently; my fastest submission time was 13min 23sec and the best rank was 290<sup>th</sup> &mdash;
                not particularly bad, but with room for improvement. On Day 1, there were about 41.000 submissions. Less than 10% of these participants also submitted a solution for Day 25.
